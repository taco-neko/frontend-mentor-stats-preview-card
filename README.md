## Overview

This challenge was surpringly harder than I expected it to be. I also tried to use proper semantic markup because I hadn't been doing that before.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I tried to use a mobile-first workflow with this but to be honest... that made things a hassle for me. I'm much more comfortable designing the desktop layout first. I think I'll just do that from now on instead of forcing myself to get used to mobile-first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using `mix-blend-mode`. I really love the fact that we can use blend modes in CSS, since I come from a design background where I used those all the time.

### Continued development

I need to start timing myself and seeing how long it takes me to do these projects. Speed isn't the goal for me, but I need to know how long I'm taking so that I know what to tell my clients.
